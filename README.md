# Skill as a Service

Run any Rebyte skill as a cloud API. Create tasks, attach skills, poll for results, and send follow-ups -- all from code.

## How to use

Paste the following URL into any Rebyte coding agent and ask it to install the skill:

`https://github.com/ReByteAI/skill-as-a-service-skill`

That's it!
